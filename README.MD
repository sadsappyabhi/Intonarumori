### Inventory Tracking System for Record Stores and Labels

Intonarumori is an inventory tracking system aimed at Record Stores and Labels within the underground and niche genre communities. 

This is a slowly-evolving work-in-progress project that I am using to practice/showcase my abilities while I 
continue my coursework towards my B.S. in Computer Science. This is why you will likely see the majority of commits 
taking place between semesters.
